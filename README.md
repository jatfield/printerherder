Work in progress web application to manage printers and provide data on usage and repairs. 
Inspired by the experience of using several bloated and manufacturer-dependent solutions and based on
a previous app developed using Ruby on Rails.
It's a study project ATM to experiment with Node.JS, Express, Webpack etc.
